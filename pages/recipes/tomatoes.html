    </ul>

    <h2>Recipe:</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Remove the core from the heirloom tomatoes and slice them into bite-sized wedges. Cut the cherry tomatoes in half. Transfer tomatoes to a bowl and season with a large pinch of salt, about 1 teaspoon. Stir to combine, being careful not to break up the tomatoes.</li>
        <li>Zest the lemon, then use the same zester to grate the garlic cloves (watch your fingers!).</li>
        <li>Warm olive oil in a small pan. Once hot, add the cumin, thyme, and coriander, stirring until fragrant, about 1 minute. Add garlic and turn off the heat. Add in lemon zest. This is now the best olive oil mixture in the world.</li>
        <li>Place pita chips in a heatproof bowl. Mix with 2 tablespoons of the flavored oil, being careful not to break the chips into crumbs.</li>
        <li>Add the juice of the lemon, honey, and remaining salt to the flavored oil. Whisk to emulsify.</li>
        <li>Add the oiled pita chips to the tomatoes. Gently mix in the feta, basil, and mint. Finally, dress with the lemon mixture.</li>
        <li>Enjoy one of the best salads your tongue can ever experience!</li>
