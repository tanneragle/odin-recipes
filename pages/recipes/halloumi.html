    <h1>Grain Bowl with Halloumi and Cucumber Slaw</h1>

    <h3>Yields:</h3>
    <p>Serves 4</p>

    <h3>Active Time:</h3>
    <p>20 minutes</p>

    <h3>Total Time:</h3>
    <p>30 minutes (plus cooking time for grains)</p>

    <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>3 cups cooked grains like farro or brown rice (see note for farro instructions)</li>
        <li>8-10 oz. halloumi, cut into 1-inch pieces</li>
        <li>1 (15 oz.) can chickpeas, drained, rinsed, and shaken dry</li>
        <li>Large handful of kale, washed and roughly chopped</li>
        <li>4 Persian or mini seedless cucumbers</li>
        <li>2 limes or lemons</li>
        <li>Large handful of freshly chopped herbs like cilantro, dill, parsley, or a mix of any</li>
        <li>¼ cup olive oil, plus more as needed</li>
        <li>1 tsp ground cumin</li>
        <li>Kosher salt and black pepper</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Recipe:</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Place rack six inches or so under broiler and heat to high.</li>
        <li>Put grains, halloumi, kale, and chickpeas in a large bowl, making sure everything is nice and dry as you add it. Season with kosher salt. Add ¼ cup olive oil and cumin, and stir to combine. Line a sheet pan with parchment paper and spread grain mixture out into a single layer. (If doing ahead, place mixture on sheet pan before adding oil and spices and refrigerate. Add spices and oil right before cooking.)</li>
        <li>Place grain mixture under broiler and set a timer for 8 minutes, stirring things around halfway through to prevent burning. Cook up to 10-12 minutes if you want more browning, but be sure not to let things burn.</li>
        <li>Meanwhile, smash cucumbers with the side of your knife. Coarsely chop and add to a bowl along with any juices that leaked onto your cutting board. Season with salt. Zest lime or lemon over the cucumbers, then squeeze the juice in. Add herbs and 1 tablespoon of olive oil and stir to combine. Set aside. (This can be prepared up to 3 hours in advance).</li>
        <li>Once the grain mixture is done cooking, taste for seasoning with salt, pepper, and citrus juice.</li>
        <li>Serve grain mixture in a bowl topped with cucumber slaw.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Helpful Notes:</h2>
    <p>Farro increases by about twice its volume when cooked. For this recipe, I usually cook 1-2 cups of farro in 4-6 cups of vegetable stock. This will give you a little extra, which is never a bad thing. You can use it all in this dish for extra fiber or save the extra for something else.</p>
